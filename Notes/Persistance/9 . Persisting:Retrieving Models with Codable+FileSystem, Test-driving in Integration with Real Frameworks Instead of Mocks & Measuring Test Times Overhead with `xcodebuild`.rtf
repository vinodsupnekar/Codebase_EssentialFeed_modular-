Dependency Inversion Anatomy (High-level | Boundary | Low-level), Defining Inbox Checklists and Contract Specs to Improve Collaboration and Avoid Side-effect Bugs in Multithreaded Environments\
\
1. We implemented File system framework to retrieve and store image feeds .\
\
2. In above process we saw that LocalFeedImage which is part of another generic Module , needs to be modified as a Codable, which is not correct way as its creating dependency from framework specific module to more generic module.\
\
To fix this , we created another type CodableFeedStore, and used mapping technique to map it to FeedImage , which resolves the dependency.\
\
3.Later we recafotred the CodableFeedStoreTests to move away from hard coded url to factory methods , and create test specific store as it might be used by other Tests / Files going forward\
