Chapter . Â  A Classicist TDD Approach (No Mocking) to Mapping JSON with Decodable + Domain-Specific Models

1.We have added tests for covering error cases for non - 200 http response code, and according modifies Client protocol and then later on Feed Feature protocol to give back FeedItem response back.

2.FeedItem class has API details like coding keys related information like "image" to "imageURL" mapping data visible in Feed Feature module.
Now this can affect our abstraction as it is API module details(RemoteFeedLoader).

3.We added Item inside API Module (RemoteFeed Loader) , and mapped it to FeedItem(Feed Feature component), so that we are not leaking any implementation details outside the API module now.
